Project Title Scania Truck Failures
Domain Transportation

Problem Statement:
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that
uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing
the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the
easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air.
This is a Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the
failure was caused by a certain component of the APS, while the negative class
indicates that the failure was caused by something else.

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thats best fit for the above case.

Results: You have to build a solution that should able to predict whether a failure of a
Scania Truck component is related to the air pressure system (APS) or not.
